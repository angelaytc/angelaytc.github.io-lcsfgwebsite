              <h2>Story Summary</h2>   
                  "The sky brightened abruptly. A deafening noise crashed from the top of the fountain. Countless cracks zigzagged from the center of the dark blue welkin. Wind and stars tumbled through the opening and fell into the sea. The dome continued to crack open, as if the beanstalk was pushing, growing, forcing its way deeper beyond the barrier. My head rang from the thunderous noise, and my eyes were filled with fantastic visions that eventually melded into a single blinding brightness.
                  The crystal sky fell."
                  <br><br>
                  - from Under a Dangling Sky by Cheng Jingbo, translated by Ken Liu (2019) 
                  <br><br>
                  *   *   *
                  <br><br>
                  "Under a Dangling Sky" floats us from the region of Rainville into a dreamy mapping that spans the breadth of the sky and oceans, to the verticality of two planets' gravitational axes. In search for the dolphin's song, the protagonist whimsically observes the water cycle's interactions with the elements. That is until the crystal sky falls and collides with the sea, and the strange process births new stars to become the Delphinus constellation.
                  <br><br>
                  Cheng Jingbo draws inspiration from Greek mythology, the fairytale Jack and the Beanstalk and David Brin's SSF The Crystal Spheres to form this spatially generous speculative short story.
                  <br><br>
                  The short story  can be found in its original publication in ​"Science Fiction World" 《科幻世界》in 2004, and its English translation by Ken Liu for his edited collection "Broken Stars" (2019). You may also contact the LCSFG (by email) to receive an e-copy in English and/or Chinese, distributed with the author's permission and limited to this session.

                  <h3>The author</h3>
                 Cheng Jingbo (aka ‘Bo’) represents China’s new generation of female science fiction writers. In 1999, Bo published her first story ‘Think Like an Apple’ as part of the first sci-fi magazine sold to a global audience, Science Fiction World. The story won First Prize in the Teenager Sci-Fi Writers Awards, an accolade which served as an astronomical platform for Bo and cemented an unshakeable connection between herself, science fiction, and the infinite possibilities of the universe’s mysteries.

             In 2002, her story ‘Western Paradise’ was nominated for a Galaxy Award. In 2010, ‘Lost in Luoyang’ won First Prize in the Youth Literature Awards hosted by the Chinese Contemporary Literature Research Association, and also went on to win Best Short Story in the First Xingyun (Nebula) Awards for Global Chinese Science Fiction.

In 2019, Bo won Screenwriter of the Year in the First Chinese International Writer Festival held by the China Youth Press for her sci-fi script ‘Hotel 8’. In the same year, Bo also won First Prize in the Leng Hu Sci-Fi Awards for her sci-fi novelette ‘Host’. Bo’s works have been translated into several languages, including English, Japanese, German, Italian and Spanish.

              <h2>Event Summary</h2>
            <p>In the session, we discussed the genre tropes of sci-fi and speculative fiction, particularly in relation to stories that play with ‘realism’. We also paid attention to the stylistic and conceptual architecture of Hao’s imagery of geologic social division in the near future, folding version of Beijing. 
              <br><br>Following the trajectory of Lao Dao’s immense physical journey as well as his conflicted realisation of how the ‘better off’ live, we discussed the precarity of migrant workers in China, automation of large scale industries, the disparity of socio-economic classes, consequences of international development schemes and the dreams and reality of social mobility for Lao Dao and his daughter Tang Tang. 
              <br><br>We also debated the projected gender roles in Lao Dao’s hopes for Tang Tang’s future as a First Space ‘lady’, after he delivers a message to Yi Yan, although she is trapped in a loveless marriage. Finally, we contended to whether the ending of “Folding Beijing” is successful in instilling hope in the reader, in the face of a wider struggle against classed-based injustice.
