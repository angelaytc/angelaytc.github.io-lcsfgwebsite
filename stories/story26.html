         <h2>Story Summary</h2>
          <br><br>
           "Everyone needs ideals in life, don’t they?<br>
           Jia Su’s ideal was to create a machine.<br>
           Bubbles’s ideal was to make revolution.<br>
           Meiying’s ideal was to make an honest woman of herself."
 <br><br>
 "In the middle of the lab stood a gigantic figure made of brass, its many arms outstretched like a thousand-armed Buddhist guardian god. In each hand, there were glass containers of different colors and sizes. The liquids they held were of colors seen only in dreams. They oscillated and sang."
<br>- from 1923—a Fantasy /《一九二三年科幻故事》by Zhao Haihong /  赵海虹

  <br><br>
  We're thrilled to invite author Zhao Haihong to join our next meeting in late June, to discuss her story 1923—a Fantasy, translated by Nicky Harman and Pang Zhaoxia.
  <br><br>
  In this short story, a great-grandchild discovers an old, padlocked box, kept hidden throughout the Cultural Revolution, that supposedly holds the family’s genealogical records. Instead, the contents intriguingly reveals to be two sealed containers of liquids. They are a part of the great-grandfather's innovation, the 'aqua-dream machine', which was a device that used "the power of water to retain memory.”
  <br><br>
  1923—a Fantasy is a confluence of narratives in the unstable China of the 1920s: a nearly forgotten moment in a family's history; the love story between hostess dancer Meiying and Western-educated Jia Su; his solidarity with Bubbles the revolutionary, and the haziness of Jia Su's laboratory of liquid and steam memories. Zhao's writing style allows for an intimate-at-a-distance approach to the characters, holding the nostaligia for '20s Shanghai at an arms length by soundtracking the story with an informed contextualisation of the period's social unease.

The original Chinese version was published in 2007's fifth issue of《世界科幻博览》. Please get in touch if you need access to these texts.
   <br><br>

If you don't get a chance to read the story until afterwards, do feel welcome to join nonetheless. As always, please respond to us by email and we'll send you the Zoom details a day prior the event.
