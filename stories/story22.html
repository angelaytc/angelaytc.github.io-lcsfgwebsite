          <h1>"Formerly Slow" / 《从前慢》 (2019) by Wei Ma / 未马
          <br>Translated by Andy Dudak (2020)</h1>
         <h3>Our reading and meeting for February 2021 </br></br> Sunday 28th February, 2pm GMT, email for Zoom details</h3><h2>Story Summary</h2>
           We're very pleased to invite Wei Ma to our February videocall session to chat with our readers about her short SF story, "Formerly Slow" / 
           《从前慢》translated from Chinese into English by Andy Dudak, 2020).

            "As if separated by time, like two different worlds, Xia Mang thought to himself.
            <br><br>
            Regardless of how Xiao An would have preferred it, Weiwei’s dormancy issue couldn’t be resolved, in the end. Thus, SIP proposed a compensation plan, while vowing to continue regular examinations and dormancy tests of Weiwei. Shenli City even made exceptions for the family, granting an extraordinary privilege: total freedom of movement."
            <br><br> ... <br><br>
            "People here lived as in air bubbles in the ocean of time. They followed one of seven non-intersecting trajectories, jumping from one air bubble to another. The lives and times of the other six trajectories were completely cut off from them, had nothing to do with them.
            <br><br>
            Xia Mang and Weiwei were like fish in this ocean, darting back and forth. Time flowed along their bodies continuously, dense, adhering them to all that surrounded them. Every change in this world left its mark on their bodies."

            Shenli City is an enviable and competitive place to live, with its cleaner air, less crowded transportation system and comfortable streets. This is thanks to dormancy tech, which allows citizens to sleep for most of the week, waking only on their assigned day for Freedom-of Movement. They carry out their regular lives within the city, but with slower aging, faster brain calculations and closer-knit day communities. However, dormancy rights are not approved for everyone in the city; they are considered an earned privillege.
            <br><br>
            When the dormancy tech inexplicably fails to induce baby Weiwei into her first certified sleep, her parents are forced to live to their natural, biological clocks to raise her everyday of the week. Her mother, Xiao An, is reluctant to do this, and soon succumbs to the societal and career pressures to return to dormancy, also believing her "privillege" should not be wasted. Xia Mang is left to raise Weiwei, but he feels more optimistic. As the father and daughter live out everyday together, meeting Xiao An and other friends only on their one 'awake' day of the week, they both age faster than those in dormancy. Yet Xia Mang embraces the strange slowness he also feels as a result.
            <br><br>
            Wei Ma (pen name) writes a compelling story of people living within the same space and time, yet vastly separated by their varying rates of lived experience. Formerly Slow grasps at how this intersects with family life, friendships, impending death and urban living, while speculating the benefits and frictions of what it could mean to slow down and 'live the life to the full'.
