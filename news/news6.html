                A whimsical and unsettling novel by one of China's most acclaimed young writers, told in the form of a bestiary.
                <br><br> 
                In the fictional Chinese town of Yong’an, human beings live alongside spirits and monsters, some of which are almost indistinguishable from people. The narrator, an amateur cryptozoologist, is on a mission to track down each breed in turn, but in the process discovers that she might not be as human as she thought. As her research leads her inexorably to the City of the Dead and its secrets, she begins to question how certain she can be that anyone around her is truly human, or if ‘human’ and ‘monster’ are really such different categories.
                <br><br>
